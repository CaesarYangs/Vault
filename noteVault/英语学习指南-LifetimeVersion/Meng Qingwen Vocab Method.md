# 5 Effective Vocabulary Learning Tips
Needless to say, vocabulary is central to language learning. The range
and quality of vocabulary make or break your linguistic prowess, and
more importantly, your confidence. Knowing how and how not to learn
vocab goes a long way. Here are 5 tips to make your vocab learning more
effective.
1. Prioritize. Not all words are created equal. It's futile to try to
memorize every word you see in print. Some words are more useful,
relatable, and worth learning than others. Focus on them. Words are
like people; we are not meant to know and like everyone.
2. Learn words in context. Whenever you can, learn words from reading
and listening. Context-based learning boosts memorization. Even
when you have to study vocab books, try to compose sentences using
the words you just learned. This way, you are creating proper context
for the lone words. Words come alive in context.
3. Repetition is the key. Assuming you are working on the right words, if
you haven't mastered them, you simply haven't repeated enough.
Repetition, or hard work, should solve much of the problem.
4. There is more to the meaning of a word. Many beginners have a
narrow view of vocab. As long as they know what a word means, they
are content. However, that's only the first step. Being able to explain a
word in plain English, mastering its common collocations, and being
aware of its register are all critical aspects of vocab learning. Depth
matters.
5. Active vocab over passive vocab. It's not the number of words you
know that counts, but the number of words you know how to use.
Words are like tools. If you never use or sharpen them, they will be
rusty and unusable. **Turn more passive vocab into active vocab by
using.** Your linguistic skills boil down to your active vocab.

To sum up, be selective; value context; repeat enough: go deeper; active
before passive. Off you go on the joyous journey of English learning.
