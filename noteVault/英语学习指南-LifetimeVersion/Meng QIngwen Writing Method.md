# 4 Tips to Help You Start Writing
Well begun is half done. But the truth is that getting started is
enough. It doesn't even have to begin well. Most people sit on the
to-start-or-not-to-start fence and never make the jump. Here are 4
tips about how to start writing.
1. Start small. Don't look up to literary luminaries or try to begin by
writing a book-length masterpiece. Producing a couple of
sentences is fine. **Try to capture small, fleeting observations,
ideas, and thoughts that were deemed undeserving of
formulation.** Only progress when you have gotten the hang of
"mini writing
2. Done is better than perfect. Perfection is an illusion unsuited to
beginners. Conscientiousness is understandable and laudable,
but perfection shouldn't get in the way of getting the work done
Consistence begins with getting on with imperfection
3. Turn imaginary conversations into writing. If you feel you have
something to say to someone, you have something to write
about. Writing can feel overwhelming, and it is. One trick to get
over this is to imagine that when you write, you talk to someone
You basically just note down your spoken words. This can give
you a jump-start when you struggle with what to write.
4. Share your writing. Writing is hard and lonely. Encouragement
and engagement fuel consistence. Don't call it day until you
share what you write. Send it to your loved ones and friends. Ask
how they like it, whether they can relate to it, and what they
think about the issue. Turn your writing into a conversation
Begun is almost done. Start writing now and feel the joy of writing.
